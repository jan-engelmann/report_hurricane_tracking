    abstract = { Tropical cyclones encompass virtually every subdiscipline of geophysical fluid dynamics, including cumulus convection, boundary layers, thermodynamic cycles, surface wave dynamics, upper ocean wind-driven circulations, barotropic instability, Rossby waves, and air-sea interaction. After briefly reviewing what is known about the structure, behavior, and climatology of these fascinating storms, the author provides an overview of their physics, focusing on the unique and poorly understood nature of the air-sea interface, and discusses several of the most interesting avenues of ongoing research. }

    abstract = "{The 2005 Atlantic hurricane season was the most active of record. Twenty-eight storms occurred, including 27 tropical storms and one subtropical storm. Fifteen of the storms became hurricanes, and seven of these became major hurricanes. Additionally, there were two tropical depressions and one subtropical depression. Numerous records for single-season activity were set, including most storms, most hurricanes, and highest accumulated cyclone energy index. Five hurricanes and two tropical storms made landfall in the United States, including four major hurricanes. Eight other cyclones made landfall elsewhere in the basin, and five systems that did not make landfall nonetheless impacted land areas. The 2005 storms directly caused nearly 1700 deaths. This includes approximately 1500 in the United States from Hurricane Katrina—the deadliest U.S. hurricane since 1928. The storms also caused well over \$100 billion in damages in the United States alone, making 2005 the costliest hurricane season of record.}",
