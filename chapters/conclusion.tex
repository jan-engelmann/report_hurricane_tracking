\chapter{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
This project significantly improved the speed and efficiency of a TC tracking algorithm. This speedup enables a comprehensive analysis of different parameter threshold settings. An exploratory data analysis revealed interesting aspects of the different tracking criteria as outlined before. The capability to quickly try different parameter combinations and the already produced tracking data empowers a wide range of further analysis steps. One idea would be to try to reduce \newline
Furthermore the combination of several criteria is a perspective for continuing research and development. It would for instance be interesting to only track storms that satisfy the at least two of three given parameter threshold combinations.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item repeat most important findings
    \item mention further algorithm ideas
    \item suggest more elaborate parallelization with eg dask for improved simulation data reading
\end{enumerate}
